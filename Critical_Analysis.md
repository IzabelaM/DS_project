### Critical Analysis

The overall output of the project was the web-based interactive experience. We done this by creating a story that explores young peopleâ€™s mental health issues. This document will discuss what was done and how it could be improved if someone were to take it further.  

Animations are used to emphasise the elements on the site that the visitor can interact with. The animations are also timed to assist the user in following the experience. Before implementing this, a number of methods of interaction were discussed ranging from pop-ups to buttons the user would need to click on. Due to a lack of technical knowledge, we were unable to get the interactive elements to pop-up automatically as the user scrolled through the page so instead we decided that the user would need to hover over the element for the text to display on the page. The problems page of the site is not interactive so this would need developed further. One idea we had, was that the different issues would be clickable and would take the visitor to the Childline page about the specific issue.  

The storytelling throughout the experience is delivered as characters thoughts, feelings and quotes. This was to emotionally engage the visitor with the characters and to immerse them in the story. We feel that this could have been done better by having more interactive elements that contain more engaging content for the visitor.  

Some of the elements in the experience, contain large text excerpts. This means that the visitor would not have a good experience when visiting the site on a small device. The site is also not responsive for mobile devices and is not fully accessible, which means that the target audience for the site is reduced. It would be important that this is corrected if the site were to be developed further.  

Overall, we feel that we could have worked better as a team, however we are happy with our final submission.

8. Epilogue  
 
A few weeks later…  
 
I swung myself out of the bus, glancing around me. "I am so nervous, today is my first day in this school" I thought. The school was beautiful, old and still. I couldn't hardly believe I would be studying in that place for the rest of my academic life. The surroundings were littered with blossoming trees that were showing off exotic looking flowers and fruits. After a quick look around the gardens, I set out for my classroom.   

Earlier in the day, I had brushed my teeth and had tied back my long blonde hair. I had taken all the precautions and necessary measures so that nobody hated me. As I entered the room, like a cloudy sky on a winter morning, the whole room was filled with a subdued grey and silence reigned between those four walls. How are they going to react? Will they think I'm weird? What's going on in their heads right now? The teacher introduced me to the class and pointed to one of the desks that were empty so I could sit there.  
 
"She can sit on the desk next to mine" someone shouted. The voice came from the back of the room and I recognised it was from a teen boy even if I couldn't see where it came from.  
 
I went to sit to the designated desk. I rolled my eyes at him and he brought his hand up. I held out my hand to him. "Noah" he stated as he shook my hand. "Rapunzel" I responded, quickly pulling my hand back from his.  
 
I glanced over to Noah and looked down at the ground, hiding my growing blush. What's up with me? I never blush! It's the first boy who chatted with me in such a long time without any sexual intention. He looked at me and I looked at him as my face was going even redder. We went over the types of books we like and all the novels we read before.  
 
"I know you don't really know me and you are obviously still settling in our school, but would you like to… maybe… hang out sometime… just talk after school… or whatever… you know" he said. I stared at him with wide eyes and mouth gaping wide open. "Are you asking me to be your friend?" I asked incredulously. He nodded his head and my notebook slipped unconsciously from my hands until landing on the floor. I was in shock. I had the opportunity to make a friend. "The first friend I'd had since I was in third grade when everything fell apart." I thought. He immediately rushed to pick up my notebook and handed it back to me. I held it against my chest, head down due to emotion. I looked at him. Slowly, I nodded my head and his face broke out into a smile that took my breath away.  
 
I did it. I made a friend. Who knows? Perhaps life has a meaning after all.
